# affinity

This project has moved to Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/kuhl/affinity

Affinity measures the similarity between text files. It was originally designed to help course instructors look for similarities in source code that students turn in for programming assignments. However, it can provide similarity scores for any pair of text files. If no other options are provided, affinity will take the list of input files, enumerate every possible pair of files, and then calculates and prints the amount of similarity of those tiles. The output is sorted by the similarity scores.
